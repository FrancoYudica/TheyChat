- **Group Chat:** Support for group conversations, allowing multiple users to chat simultaneously.

## Technologies Used

- **C Programming Language:** Core language used for implementing the chat application.
- **TCP/IP:** Communication protocol for transmitting data over the network.
- **Cryptography:** Libraries or algorithms for message encryption and decryption.
- **Multi-threading:** Utilization of multi-threading for handling multiple connections concurrently.
- **File I/O:** Reading and writing files for storing user data and chat history.
- **Makefile:** Building and managing the project with Makefile.
